## About
The name is derived from the Latin words Scripto (Write) and Mentem (Mind). 

This is my own spin on a note taking application with cloud sync features. If it works well, I might add some diagramming and drawing features for brainstorms, UI mockups, ERD/DFD/UML, SPF30+, etc.

## Planned features (in development order)
- Import from Evernotes' export.
- Sync to cloud using Google Drive API, https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/appdata
- Desktop application using Electron, https://electron.atom.io/
- Markdown and Image embedding support, live WYSIWYG and code editing
- Mobile application pending research (suggest me a framework!)

## Mockups
