## About
A desktop (and hopefully mobile) app that can use file or Google Drive based storage.

This is my own spin on a note taking application with cloud sync features. If it works well, I might add some diagramming and drawing features for brainstorms, UI mockups, ERD/DFD/UML, SPF30+, etc.

## Planned features (in development order)
- Import from Evernotes' export.
- Sync to cloud using Google Drive API, https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/appdata
- Service worker for offline use
