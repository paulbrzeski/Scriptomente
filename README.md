A cloud based note taking tool

## About
This is my own spin on a note taking application with cloud sync features. If it works well, I might add some diagramming and drawing features for brainstorms, UI mockups, ERD/DFD/UML, concept drawings, etc.

## Planned features (in development order)
- Import from Evernote and possibly OneNote (on request)
- Sync to cloud using Google Drive API, https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/appdata
- Desktop application using Electron, https://electron.atom.io/
- Markdown and Image embedding support, live WYSIWYG and code editing
- Mobile application pending research (suggest me a framework!)
